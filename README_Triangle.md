# Predictive_Crash_Final_Triangle_Segment1

## Method

The initial approach for predicting the severity of crashes in Fort Bend County, Texas will be a logistic regression model. Specifically, the logistic regression model will be used to produce the probability of crashed resulting in an incapacitating injury, including death. 

The initial model is being developed using limited data points, in this case 500. A logistic regression model was chosen for its ease of dissection and interpretation and its acceptance by many data scientists and non-data experts.

That said, it is likely that the number of data points and features will increase substantially as the data are finalized, thereby requiring a more complex model like a neural network. The neural network will not be overwhelmed by a data set with thousands of data points and dozens of features, as the logistic regression model may. Stay tuned.
