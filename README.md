## Technologies used for project

## Week 1

### Data Cleaning and Analysis

- For the data cleaning and analysis we will be using Pandas, NumPy, and Python.

### Database Storage

- The database will be hosted on Postgres, and we will integrate Tableau to visualize our data.

### Machine Learning

- We will utilize the Python machine learning library SciKitLearn to create a model. We will accomplish this by training our model with three subsets: 70% training set, 15% validation set, and 15% test set. We will use classification model.

### Dashboard

- We will host our dashboard using Tableau Public.
