## Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
For the data cleaning and analysis we will be using Pandas, NumPy, and Python.

## Database Storage
The database will be hosted on Postgres, and we will integrate Tableau to visualize our data.

## Machine Learning
We will utilize the Python machine learning library SciKitLearn to create a model. We will accomplish this by training our model with three subsets: 70% training set, 15% validation set, and 15% test set. 

## Dashboard
We will host our dashboard using Tableau Public.
